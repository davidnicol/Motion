We maintain a strong distinction between names and things.
Names are character strings, while things are motes.
Names are found in lexicons, and can be placed into the current
lexicon with the NAME [name] [thing] operator.

As the current lexicon does not persist beyond the life
of the parser containing it, the REMEMBER [name] operator
serves to copy a name to thing mapping into the lexicon
one level out from the current lexicon.

Within a persistent WORKSPACE, REMEMBER serves to make a name
persist.

Within a SAFE, REMEMBER will write names into the empty outer
lexicon.

the result of a SAFE [keyword-list] [sequence] operation is
that lexicon, allowing SAFE to be used to construct lexicon
objects.
