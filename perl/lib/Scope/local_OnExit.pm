=head1 NAME

Scope::local_OnExit - an execute-at-scope-exit mechanism using C<local>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  our $onExit;
  use Scope::local_OnExit;
  ...
  sub SomethingCritical{
     local$OnExit=\&release_lock;
     obtain_lock;
     ...
  }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This very short module provides a pure-perl mechanism for executing
perl code at scope exit, at the time that the "old value" is returned to
the tied variable.

=head2 PORTING FROM Scope::OnExit

Instead of

   on_scope_exit { do_something($var) };

one would code

   local$OnExit=sub{ do_something($var) };

=head2 EXPORT

the scalar package variable C<$OnExit> is tied into the package.

To tie a different variable than C<$OnExit>, use empty parentheses
on the C<use> line to suppress C<import> and tie the variable of your
selection.
