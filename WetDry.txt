Capability object "membrane" theory
(see http://soft.vub.ac.be/~tvcutsem/invokedynamic/js-membranes )
has a very useful concept of "wet" and "dry" zones, regarding
a "membrane" abstraction.

In Motion, messages must consist of tokens that exist in the
current lexicon, including the lexicons of outer scopes, bounded
externally by motes directly referred to by their mote identifiers.

Aside from mote identifiers which are inherently wet and should only
be shared when they identify dry motes, Motion enforces a basic wet/dry
distinction based on what is visible in the current lexicon.

Wet: not in current lexicon
Dry: in current lexicon
