the motion types system

Types, like everything else, are motes.

Every mote has a type, which affects operations like so:

1: arguments to sequences and other ops specify a type, and provided 
   arguments must either match that type or have a defined conversion
   to that type otherwise the operation fails.

2: a type mote may specify a prototype type mote, as in Javascript
   or other languages with a single-inheritance object discipline.

3: Coercions are the responsibility of the type of the mote used
   as the operand. Verification of coercion is the responsibility of
   the desired type.

In the default lexicon, which may be limited or changed in application
environments, these are the predefined types:

MOTE the base object type, the default default prototype

AA "Associative Array" 

LEXICON an AA with an "outer" reference, for scoping

TYPE the base type type

OP Operator. Consumes zero or more arguments and produces one result. Can temporarily replace the engine's parser.

STREAM a stream of characters, for either reading or writing or both, a 
   file handle.

ENGINE takes two stream arguments, reads from the first, writes to the second

PARSER 

STRING

NUMBER

BOOLEAN

LIST

ANYTHING: a degenerate type name that accepts anything

Names of types can be used as instance constructors
