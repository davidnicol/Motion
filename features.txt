Features of Motion for comparison and contrast with other languages


simple LL grammar

strict separation of things and their names, allowing easy
translation into other languages, and security by forgetting names; one could call this "ephemeral binding"

single-parent inheritance model

transparent persistence and ephemerance

balance between compile-time and process time resolution and coercion

LISP-like semantics; SQL-like syntax

Where LISP uses parentheses for associating operators and operands,
Motion uses argument counting: all operator motes consume a set
number of operand motes, like machine language operators consume
a set number of operand words.
