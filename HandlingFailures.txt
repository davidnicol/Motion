Exception handling in Motion:

Motion EH is based on C++ EH, except that no "try" is needed.

The keyword to throw an exception is FAIL which takes one argument,
which must be a base_failure or a type descended from base_failure.

The keyword to catch an exception is HANDLE which takes two
arguments. The first is the failure type that the handle will receive,
and the second is a sequence that takes one argument.

At FAIL time, the appropriate handler is found by examing
handlers in declaration order from the innermost scope outward until
a handler that can accept the thrown exception is found.

Once the handler has been found, its sequence is performed with
the exception as argument.

Information can be attached to a failure using the FAILURE keyword,
which takes two arguments, the first a failure type, and the second any mote,
that will be given to the handler when the new failure type is handled.

The FAILURE keyword consumes its two arguments and yields a new
failure type mote.

See TESTS.pl for examples of usage.
