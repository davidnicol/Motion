CONTEXTS

the interactions of the MOTE keyword, types, and operators.

There are two implicit contexts: OP context and RESULT context.
Any mote can appear in any context, but usually that causes a failure.

Argument types create a context; every type can be a context.

Type keywords, as ops, function as constructors.
